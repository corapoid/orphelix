## Development Workflow

### Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `chore/` - Build, dependencies, etc.

### Make Changes

Follow our coding standards:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Code Style">
    **TypeScript:**
    - Use TypeScript for all new code
    - Avoid `any` type
    - Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
    
    **Formatting:**
    - Prettier handles formatting (runs on save)
    - 2 spaces for indentation
    - Single quotes for strings
    - Semicolons optional
    
    **Naming:**
    - `camelCase` for variables and functions
    - `PascalCase` for components and types
    - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
    - `kebab-case` for file names
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="react" title="React/Next.js">
    **Components:**
    - Use functional components with hooks
    - Prefer named exports over default exports
    - Keep components under 300 lines
    - Extract reusable logic to custom hooks
    
    **Hooks:**
    - Name custom hooks `use*`
    - Keep hooks under 150 lines
    - Use TanStack Query for data fetching
    - Use Zustand for global state
    
    **Files:**
    - One component per file
    - Co-locate types with components
    - Use `@/` path alias for imports
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="layer-group" title="API Routes">
    **Structure:**
    - One route per file
    - Export named functions (GET, POST, etc.)
    - Keep routes under 200 lines
    - Extract business logic to lib/
    
    **Error Handling:**
    - Always try-catch async operations
    - Return appropriate HTTP status codes
    - Include error messages in response
    - Log errors for debugging
    
    **Example:**
    ```typescript
    export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
      try {
        const data = await fetchData()
        return Response.json(data)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('[API] Error:', error)
        return Response.json(
          { error: error.message },
          { status: 500 }
        )
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="vial" title="Testing">
    **Required:**
    - Add unit tests for new features
    - Add E2E tests for user flows
    - Ensure all tests pass before PR
    
    **Coverage:**
    - Aim for 80%+ coverage
    - Test edge cases and errors
    - Mock external dependencies
    
    **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    npm run test:e2e
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
