## Actions

### Restart Deployment

Perform a rolling restart (equivalent to `kubectl rollout restart`):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Restart Button">
    In the list view or detail view, click the **"Restart"** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Action">
    A dialog appears asking for confirmation

    <Warning>
      This triggers a rolling restart of all pods. Ensure your deployment has multiple replicas to avoid downtime.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Watch the deployment status change to "Progressing" as pods restart
  </Step>

  <Step title="Completion">
    Status returns to "Available" when all pods are ready
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Use Cases:**
- Apply configuration changes from ConfigMaps/Secrets
- Clear pod-level issues
- Restart after environment updates
- Force image pull (if using :latest tag)

### Edit YAML

Edit deployment manifest and create a Pull Request:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open YAML Editor">
    Click **"Edit YAML"** button in detail view
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Monaco editor appears with full YAML manifest

    <Tip>
      Editor features: syntax highlighting, auto-completion, error detection
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Common Edits">
    - Update container image tag
    - Adjust resource limits/requests
    - Add/modify environment variables
    - Change replica count
    - Update labels/annotations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Pull Request">
    Click **"Create PR"** to submit changes via GitHub integration

    <Note>
      Requires GitHub App setup. See [GitHub Integration](/user/github/overview)
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example: Update Image Tag**

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:v1.0.0  # Change to v1.1.0
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

## Filters & Search

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="All Statuses">
    Show all deployments regardless of status
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Available">
    Show only healthy deployments
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Progressing">

```

Search is case-insensitive and matches partial names.

## Related Resources

### ConfigMaps & Secrets

Deployments often reference ConfigMaps and Secrets:

<Steps>
  <Step title="View in Topology">
    See linked ConfigMaps/Secrets in the topology graph
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Resource">
    Click ConfigMap/Secret nodes to view details
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Configuration">
    Edit ConfigMap/Secret values and restart deployment to apply
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

If an HPA is configured:

- View target CPU utilization
- See min/max replica limits
- Monitor current replica count
- Navigate to HPA details

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Health Checks">
    Always configure liveness and readiness probes for zero-downtime deployments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check" title="Resource Limits">
    Set CPU/memory limits and requests to prevent resource starvation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check" title="Multiple Replicas">
    Run at least 2 replicas for high availability
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check" title="Rolling Updates">
    Use RollingUpdate strategy with appropriate maxSurge and maxUnavailable
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check" title="Image Tags">
    Use specific version tags instead of :latest for reproducibility
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Not Available

**Symptom:** Deployment shows as Degraded with 0/3 available replicas

**Possible Causes:**
- Image pull errors
- Resource limits too low
- Failed readiness probes
- Node resource constraints

**Solutions:**
1. Check Events tab for specific errors
2. View pod details and logs
3. Verify resource requests/limits
4. Check node capacity

### Pods Restarting Frequently

**Symptom:** High restart count in pods table

**Possible Causes:**
- Application crashes
- OOMKilled (memory limit exceeded)
- Failed liveness probes
- Resource constraints

**Solutions:**
1. View pod logs for crash reasons
2. Check container restart history
3. Increase memory limits if OOMKilled
4. Review liveness probe configuration

### Rolling Update Stuck

**Symptom:** Deployment stuck in "Progressing" status

**Possible Causes:**
- New pods failing readiness checks
- Insufficient cluster resources
- Pod disruption budget blocking termination

**Solutions:**
1. Check new pod logs and events
2. Verify resource availability
3. Review readiness probe configuration
4. Check pod disruption budgets
