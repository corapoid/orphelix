## Overview

The dashboard is your central hub for monitoring Kubernetes resources. It provides a quick overview of cluster health and recent activity.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Deployments" icon="layer-group">
    Total number of deployments in the selected namespace
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pods" icon="cube">
    Total number of pods across all deployments
  </Card>
  <Card title="Nodes" icon="server">
    Number of nodes in the cluster
  </Card>
  <Card title="ConfigMaps" icon="file-code">
    Configuration resources in the namespace
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secrets" icon="key">

## Recent Events

The events section shows the latest cluster activity:

- **Event Type** - Normal (info) or Warning (error)
- **Resource** - Which resource the event relates to
- **Reason** - Why the event occurred
- **Message** - Detailed description
- **Age** - How long ago the event happened

### Event Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-info" title="Normal Events">
    Routine operations like pod scheduling, image pulling, or successful health checks
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="Warning Events">
    Issues requiring attention like failed probes, image pull errors, or resource limits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Expanding Events

By default, only the 3 most recent events are shown. Click **"Show N More"** to expand and see all recent events.

## Topology Visualization

<Info>
  The topology section is collapsed by default. Click to expand and view the resource dependency graph.
</Info>

The topology graph shows relationships between:
- **Deployments** → **Pods** → **Nodes**
- **Services** → **Pods**
- **ConfigMaps/Secrets** → **Deployments**

### Graph Controls

- **Pan** - Click and drag to move the view
- **Zoom** - Use mouse wheel or pinch gesture
- **Fit View** - Double-click to center all nodes
- **Node Colors** - Status-based (green = healthy, red = error, yellow = warning)

<Warning>
  Scroll-based zoom is disabled by default to prevent accidental zooming. Use manual controls instead.
</Warning>

## Real-time Updates

When connected to a real cluster, the dashboard automatically updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connection Status">
    Check the status indicator in the top-right corner:
    - 🟢 **Connected** - Receiving live updates
    - 🟡 **Connecting** - Establishing connection
    - 🔴 **Disconnected** - Not receiving updates
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic Refresh">
    Resource counts and events update automatically when changes occur in the cluster
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manual Refresh">
    Click the refresh button (🔄) on any section to force an immediate update
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Theme Toggle

Switch between light and dark themes using the theme toggle button in the header:

- **Light Mode** - Bright, clean interface for daytime use
- **Dark Mode** - Reduced eye strain for extended use

Your preference is saved automatically and persists across sessions.
