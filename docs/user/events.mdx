## Overview

The Events page provides a comprehensive view of all Kubernetes cluster events. Events are time-stamped records of actions and state changes in your cluster, essential for troubleshooting and monitoring.

<img src="/images/events.png" alt="Events List" />

## What are Kubernetes Events?

Events are records created by Kubernetes components when:
- Resources are created, modified, or deleted
- Pods are scheduled or fail to schedule
- Containers start, stop, or crash
- Health probes fail
- Resource limits are exceeded
- Errors occur in the cluster

<Note>
  Events are stored for 1 hour by default in Kubernetes. Orphelix displays events from the current namespace.

## Search Functionality

Use the global search bar to filter events:

### Search by Object Name

```
Search: myapp
Result: Shows all events for resources containing "myapp"
```

### Search by Reason

```
Search: Failed
Result: Shows all failure events
```

### Search by Message

```
Search: "insufficient cpu"
Result: Shows scheduling failures due to CPU
```

**Search Tips:**
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial string matching
- Searches across all visible columns
- Combines with type and time range filters

## Event Count Column

The **Count** column shows how many times an event occurred:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Count = 1">
    **One-time event**
    
    Typical for:
    - Pod creation
    - Image pulls
    - Container starts
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Count > 1">
    **Recurring event**
    
    **Indicates:**
    - Ongoing issue (CrashLoopBackOff)
    - Repeated failures (ImagePullBackOff)
    - Regular operations (Probe success)
    
    <Warning>
      High counts (>10) on Warning events indicate persistent problems
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Age vs Last Seen:**
- **Age**: Time since first occurrence
- **Last Seen**: Time since most recent occurrence
- **Pattern**: Age much older than Last Seen = recurring issue

Example:
```
Count: 25
Age: 15m
Last Seen: 30s

Interpretation: Event occurred 25 times over 15 minutes, 
most recently 30 seconds ago - ongoing issue!
```

## Event Correlation

Use events to understand resource relationships:

### Example: Deployment Rollout

<Steps>
  <Step title="ScalingReplicaSet">
    ```
    Type: Normal
    Reason: ScalingReplicaSet
    Message: Scaled up replica set myapp-v2 to 3
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="SuccessfulCreate">
    ```
    Type: Normal
    Reason: SuccessfulCreate
    Message: Created pod: myapp-v2-abc123
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scheduled">
    ```
    Type: Normal
    Object: Pod/myapp-v2-abc123
    Message: Successfully assigned to node-1
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pulling">
    ```
    Type: Normal
    Object: Pod/myapp-v2-abc123
    Message: Pulling image "myapp:v2.0"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Started">
    ```
    Type: Normal
    Object: Pod/myapp-v2-abc123
    Message: Started container myapp
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting with Events

### Debugging Pod Failures

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Pod">
    Search for pod name in events
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Scheduling">
    Look for FailedScheduling events
    
    Common issues:
    - Insufficient resources
    - Node selector mismatch
    - Taint/toleration issues
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Image Pull">
    Look for Failed or ImagePullBackOff
    
    Common issues:
    - Wrong image name
    - Registry authentication
    - Network connectivity
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Container Start">
    Look for BackOff or Failed
    
    Common issues:
    - Application crash on startup
    - Missing environment variables
    - Configuration errors
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Health Probes">
    Look for Unhealthy events
    
    Common issues:
    - Probe configuration incorrect
    - Application not responding
    - Slow startup
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Identifying Patterns

**Repeated Events:**
- High count on same event = persistent issue
- Check Last Seen for recency

**Event Clusters:**
- Multiple related events at same time = cascading failure
- Example: Node NotReady → Many pod Evicted events

**Warning Clusters:**
- Many warnings in short time = cluster-wide issue
- Check node events for infrastructure problems

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Monitor Warning Events">
    Set up alerts for high warning event counts
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get events --field-selector type=Warning -w
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check" title="Use Event Logging">
    Send events to logging system for long-term retention:
    - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
    - Grafana Loki
    - Cloud logging (CloudWatch, Stackdriver)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check" title="Review Events Regularly">
    Check events daily for:
    - Recurring failures
    - Performance issues
    - Resource constraints
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check" title="Correlate with Metrics">
    Combine events with resource metrics:
    - CPU/memory usage
    - Network traffic
    - Pod restart counts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check" title="Document Common Issues">
    Create runbooks for frequent events:
    - FailedScheduling → Scale cluster
    - OOMKilling → Increase memory
    - ImagePullBackOff → Check registry
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
