## Global Search

Orphelix features a powerful global search bar located in the top header, centered in the navigation bar.

<img src="/images/global-search.png" alt="Global Search" />

### How it Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Dynamic Placeholder">
    The search placeholder changes based on the current page:
    - "Search deployments..." on the Deployments page
    - "Search pods..." on the Pods page
    - "Search nodes..." on the Nodes page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Real-time Filtering">
    As you type, the list updates instantly to show matching resources
  </Step>

  <Step title="Auto-clear">
    When you navigate to a different page, the search automatically clears
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Search Behavior

- **Case-insensitive** - Searches work regardless of letter casing
- **Partial matching** - Finds resources containing your search term anywhere in the name
- **Instant results** - No need to press Enter, results appear as you type

<Tip>
  Use keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+K` (Mac) to quickly focus the search bar
</Tip>

## Status Filters

Most resource pages include status filters to help you find specific resources quickly.

### Deployments Filters

Filter deployments by status:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check-circle" title="Available">
    Deployments with all replicas running and ready
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="spinner" title="Progressing">
    Deployments currently updating or scaling
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="exclamation-triangle" title="Degraded">
    Deployments with issues (failed pods, missing replicas)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Pods Filters

Filter pods by status:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check-circle" title="Running">
    Pods currently running normally
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Pending">
    Pods waiting to be scheduled or start
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="xmark-circle" title="Failed">
    Pods that failed to start or terminated with errors
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Succeeded">
    Completed pods (from jobs or cron jobs)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rotate" title="CrashLoopBackOff">
    Pods repeatedly crashing and restarting
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Events Filters

Filter events by:

1. **Type**
   - Normal (informational events)
   - Warning (error events)

2. **Time Range**
   - Last hour
   - Last 24 hours
   - Last 7 days
   - All time

## Combining Search and Filters

You can use search and filters together for powerful resource discovery:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a filter">
    Choose a status filter (e.g., "Failed" for pods)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Type in search">
    Enter a search term to further narrow results (e.g., "api")
  </Step>

  <Step title="View filtered results">
    The table shows only resources matching both criteria
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Search and filters work together using AND logic - resources must match both the search term AND the selected filter
</Note>

## Filter Location

<Info>
  Filters are positioned on the right side of the page header, aligned with the title and refresh button
</Info>

This layout provides:
- **Easy access** - Filters are always visible without scrolling
- **Clean interface** - No extra rows or cluttered layouts
- **Consistent positioning** - Same location across all pages

## Clearing Filters

To reset your view:

1. **Clear search** - Delete text from the search bar or navigate to another page
2. **Reset filters** - Select "All Statuses" or "All Types" from the filter dropdown

<Tip>
  The filter state persists within the page but resets when you navigate to a different section
</Tip>

## Examples

### Find all failed pods containing "api"

```
1. Navigate to Pods page
2. Select "Failed" from status filter
3. Type "api" in search bar
```

### Find recent warning events for a specific deployment

```
1. Navigate to Events page
2. Select "Warning" from type filter
3. Select "Last hour" from time range
4. Type deployment name in search bar
```
