# orphelix rebuild

Rebuild the Next.js application and restart PM2 process. This is useful after making code changes.

## What it does

The `rebuild` command performs three steps:

1. **Build** - Runs `npm run build` to create production build
2. **Sync Assets** - Copies static assets to standalone build
3. **Restart** - Restarts the PM2 process with new code

## Usage

```bash
orphelix rebuild [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Alias | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--port` | `-p` | Custom port |
| `--name` | `-n` | Instance name |

## Example

```bash
# Rebuild default instance
orphelix rebuild

# Rebuild specific instance
orphelix rebuild --name prod

# Rebuild with custom port
orphelix rebuild --port 8080
```

## When to use

Use `rebuild` when:
- You've made code changes and want to deploy them
- You've pulled latest changes from git
- You've updated dependencies
- You need a fresh build

## Difference from restart

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `restart` | Only restarts PM2 process (fast, ~1s) |
| `rebuild` | Builds + restarts (slower, ~30-60s) |

Use `restart` for configuration changes, use `rebuild` for code changes.
